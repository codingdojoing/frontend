The ribbon enables user to perform the most often used tasks (top tasks) as fast as possible. The base and first level of this component is a row of white icons with labels on an orange full width background. When the amount of icons is too big for each icon to have it's minimal width, the remaining items will be moved to a 'meer...'-dropdown. On the deeper, second level, a maximum of 3 tasks can be top tasks with icons of their own. The remaining tasks will be in the 'meer...'-dropdown. On this second level, the page title is on the left.
