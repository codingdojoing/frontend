Icons make good targets: they are typically sized large enough to be easily touched in a finger-operated UI, but also work well with a mouse cursor (in contrast to words, which can suffer from read–tap asymmetry on touch screens). Yet they save space: icons can be compact enough to allow toolbars, palettes, and so on to display many icons in a relatively small space. 

Icons are fast to recognize at a glance (if well designed) — particularly true for standard icons that people have seen and used before. There is no need to translate icons for international users, provided that the icons are mindful of cultural differences (for example, mailboxes look very different in various countries whereas envelopes look the same, therefore an envelope is a more international icon for an email program than a mailbox). Icons can be visually pleasing and enhance the aesthetic appeal of a design. They support the notion of a product family or suite when the same icons and style are used in several places. 

A user’s understanding of an icon is based on previous experience. Due to the absence of a standard usage for most icons, text labels are necessary to communicate the meaning and reduce ambiguity.
