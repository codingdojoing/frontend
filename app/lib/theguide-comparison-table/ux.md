The most helpful way to allow comparison between products is to provide comparable information, presented in a comparable way, about similar products. The product comparison table lines up two or more products side by side. From each product the corresponding features or specifications are lined up next to each other. This side-by-side comparison allows for quick and easy insight.

## What does it solve?

When comparing products that have complex specifications, a user wants quick and easy insight on where they differ. Comparing products by lining up features next to each other gives a helpful overview and allows the user to compare equivalent features he or she finds important.

## States / behaviour

* A product column can be filled with a default product or start empty.
* A single product column can also show no selector. For instance when comparing a default product with other products, or an owned product with other products.

## Animations / transitions:

When a different product is selected, the entire column should fade from transparant to content. 

## Adaptiveness / responsiveness:

* ##### Stacking:
Biggest viewports show all columns, with the feature titles on the left, outside the columns.
Smaller viewports put feature titles above features
As viewport sizes get smaller, one after the other column will disappear into the selectbox

* ##### HTML:
Biggest viewports show all columns, with the feature titles on the left, outside the columns. On smaller screens the feature titles move above features

## Accessibility
